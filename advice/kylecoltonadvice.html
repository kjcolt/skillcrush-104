			<h4>Don't look too far ahead!</h4>
			<p>You need to focus on one small thing at a time. Sometimes, after confidently making a one page website, I'd take a look at other websites and think, "How did they do this!? This is WAAAAAY beyond anything I can do...I didn't learn this yet! Am I behind!? Can I compete with someone who knows how to do THAT!?". Just remember, you're at the beginning of your journey. You'll get to the next level soon enough. Just focus on learning one small thing each day.</p>
